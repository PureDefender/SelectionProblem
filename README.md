# SelectionProblem
This project is to implement different types of sorting algorithms and use them to find the kth smallest element in a list of numbers
# Algorithms
1) Sort the array using Merge Sort and return the kth element
2) Sort the array using random Iterative Quicksort and return the kth element when it is partitioned (avoids sorting the entire array)
3) Sort the array using random Recursive Quicksort and return the kth element when it is partitioned (avoids sorting the entire array)
4) Sort the array using random recursive Quicksort and Median of Medians
